# Charge2Earn - Demo Presentation Script (1.5 minutes)

## Introduction & Problem (15 seconds)
"Hi everyone! Today I'm presenting **Charge2Earn**—a Solana-powered platform that gamifies EV charging by rewarding drivers with blockchain-based points. The problem is simple: we need to incentivize sustainable transportation, and current charging networks lack transparent reward systems."

## Core Solution & Features (45 seconds)
"Here's how it works: **First**, charging operators can register their stations on-chain by paying a 0.5 SOL fee—this creates permanent, verifiable charger records. **Second**, drivers connect their Solana wallet and select any available charging point. When they start a session, they earn **AMP points** in real-time based on charging duration—you'll see the counter update every second. **Third**, all transactions happen on Solana, so points are truly owned by users and can be traded instantly. **Fourth**, we've built a marketplace where drivers can list and sell their AMP points to others, creating a secondary economy. And **finally**, there's a live leaderboard showing top eco-drivers ranked by their AMP balance, complete with profile avatars."

## Technical Highlights (25 seconds)
"On the technical side, this is built as a **native Solana program** using Borsh serialization—no Anchor framework, giving us fine-grained control. The frontend is a modern Next.js application with wallet adapter integration for Phantom, Solflare, and other popular wallets. All state is stored on-chain using Program Derived Addresses, ensuring complete transparency. Transactions are confirmed and visible on Solana Explorer with instant notifications."

## Demo Walkthrough (20 seconds)
"So let me show you the platform: Here's our landing page with the sleek dark theme. I'll navigate to Chargers—you can see all registered stations. Selecting one shows detailed info and real-time session controls. Watch as I start charging—see those live stats updating? Time elapsed, AMP points earned, and cost in SOL. Now to the marketplace—here users can buy and sell points with a clean modal interface. And the leaderboard ranks all drivers by their AMP balance."

## Conclusion (5 seconds)
"This demonstrates how blockchain can gamify sustainable behavior and create real economic incentives for eco-friendly choices. Thank you!"
