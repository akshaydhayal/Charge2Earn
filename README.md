## 📖 Overview

**Charge2Earn** is a Solana-based decentralized application that revolutionizes electric vehicle charging by gamifying the experience through blockchain rewards. Drivers earn tradable **AMP points** for every second they charge, while operators register their charging stations on-chain, creating a transparent and incentivized ecosystem for sustainable transportation.

### Key Highlights

- ⚡ **Real-Time Rewards**: Earn AMP points every second during charging
- 🔐 **On-Chain Verification**: All transactions recorded on Solana blockchain
- 💎 **True Ownership**: Users own their rewards with full control
- 🏪 **Peer-to-Peer Marketplace**: Trade AMP points instantly
- 🏆 **Competitive Leaderboards**: Gamified eco-friendly behavior
- 🌱 **Sustainability Focus**: Incentivizing green transportation

   - Stores charger information (location, rates, pricing)
   - Owned by the charging operator
   - Created via `add_charger` instruction

2. **DriverAccount** (Account Type: 2)
   - Tracks driver's AMP point balance
   - Created on first charging session
   - Updated when sessions end

3. **SessionAccount** (Account Type: 3)
   - Records charging session details
   - Tracks start/end timestamps
   - Links charger and driver

4. **ListingAccount** (Account Type: 4)
   - Marketplace listing for AMP points
   - Contains seller, amount, and price
