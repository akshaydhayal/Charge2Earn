# Charge2Earn: Blockchain-Powered EV Charging Rewards Platform

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Charge2Earn** is a Solana-based decentralized application that revolutionizes electric vehicle charging by gamifying the experience through blockchain rewards. Drivers earn tradable **AMP points** for every second they charge, while operators register their charging stations on-chain, creating a transparent and incentivized ecosystem for sustainable transportation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. On-Chain Charger Registration

Charging operators can register their stations permanently on the Solana blockchain by paying a 0.5 SOL registration fee. This creates immutable, verifiable records of charging infrastructure, ensuring transparency and trust across the network.

Each registered charger includes detailed information such as location coordinates, power output, charging rates, and pricing‚Äîall stored securely on-chain using Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).

### 2. Real-Time Charging Sessions

Drivers connect their Solana wallet and select from available charging points. When a session begins, the platform tracks charging duration in real-time, updating every second with:

- **Elapsed Time**: Live counter showing session duration
- **AMP Points Earned**: Calculated based on charger's point rate per second
- **Total Cost**: Real-time SOL cost calculation

The gamified interface provides instant visual feedback, making the charging experience engaging and rewarding. All session data is recorded on-chain for complete transparency.

### 3. AMP Points Marketplace

Earned AMP points can be instantly traded on the peer-to-peer marketplace. Drivers can list their points at custom prices, while buyers can purchase directly using SOL. The marketplace features:

- **Slider-based Amount Selection**: Easy quantity selection with price calculation
- **Real-Time Price Display**: Instant SOL conversion for any quantity
- **Secure Transactions**: All trades executed on-chain via smart contracts

This creates a secondary economy where drivers can monetize their eco-friendly behavior, further incentivizing sustainable transportation choices.

### 4. Competitive Leaderboard

The platform features a live leaderboard ranking all drivers by their AMP point balance. The leaderboard includes:

- **Top 50 Drivers**: Ranked by total AMP points earned
- **Profile Avatars**: Auto-generated identicons for each driver
- **Real-Time Rankings**: Updated automatically as points are earned

This gamification element adds a competitive aspect, encouraging more drivers to participate and charge sustainably.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer

**Native Solana Program**: Built without Anchor framework, using Borsh serialization for fine-grained control over instruction encoding and account layouts.

**Program ID**: `9oMQzz6sMnnSZ9sDeb5pi8FEGR3uDsyuC` (Devnet)

**Account Structure**:
- **Charger Accounts**: Store operator info, location, rates, and pricing
- **Driver Accounts**: Track AMP balances for each driver
- **Session Accounts**: Record charging session history
- **Listing Accounts**: Manage marketplace offers
- **User Accounts**: Enable point trading for non-drivers

All accounts use Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure, deterministic address generation.

### Frontend Application

**Next.js 15** with App Router architecture provides server-side rendering and optimized performance. The application features:

- **Wallet Adapter Integration**: Support for Phantom, Solflare, Coinbase, Brave, and Torus wallets
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live session tracking with second-by-second updates
- **Modern UI/UX**: Dark theme with glassmorphism effects and smooth animations
- **Transaction Notifications**: Toast notifications with Solana Explorer links

### Key Transactions

1. **Add Charger**: Operators register stations (0.5 SOL fee)
2. **Start Session**: Begin charging and start earning points
3. **Stop Session**: End charging, calculate rewards, transfer SOL to operator
4. **Create Listing**: List AMP points for sale
5. **Buy Listing**: Purchase points from marketplace
6. **Cancel Listing**: Remove listing from marketplace

All transactions are visible on Solana Explorer with instant confirmation and notifications.
